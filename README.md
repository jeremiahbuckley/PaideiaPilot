# PaideiaPilot
**College choice advice for high school kids**

This is a project build, as much as conceivably possible, by ChatGPT Pro.

We chose the name PaideiaPilot to reflect the guiding philosophy behind our platform. "Paideia", rooted in Greek tradition, represents the classical ideal of education—an all-encompassing pursuit of intellectual and personal excellence. "Pilot" signifies navigation, direction, and mentorship, embodying how our system helps students chart their academic journey with data-driven insights. Together, PaideiaPilot captures our mission: to illuminate the path to college admissions success, offering students both wisdom and a strategic roadmap to achieve their highest potential. 🚀


**📌 System Architecture & Flow Diagram**

The product will consist of multiple containerized microservices, each handling a specific task. Below is a high-level architecture of the system:


**1️⃣ Data Collection & Processing**

📥 Agents:

1. CDS Scraper: Extracts SAT/ACT, GPA, class rank, AP courses, and extracurricular data from Common Data Set reports.
2. IPEDS API Connector: Fetches standardized college admission statistics from the federal IPEDS database.
3. Supplementary Data Collector: Scrapes additional college data (e.g., sports participation, admission essays, financial aid policies).
4. Student Transcript Parser: Extracts GPA, courses taken, extracurriculars, AP/IB scores from uploaded transcripts.
   
📦 Output:

1. Centralized College Database (PostgreSQL/SQLite).
2. Structured Student Profile (JSON format).
3. Standardized Admissions Model Training Data.


**2️⃣ Core Analysis Engine**

🔎 Modules:

1. College Match Predictor 🏫

🔻 Unlikely (Too selective)

Based on GPA, SAT/ACT, AP courses, class rank, extracurriculars.

2. Personalized Advice Generator 📌

Analyzes deficiencies in the student’s profile.

Provides actionable recommendations, e.g.:

“Take 2 more AP classes in Math/Science to improve competitiveness.”

“Your GPA is strong, but lack of leadership roles may hurt your chances at top schools.”

“SAT is low for your reach schools; retaking could improve your odds.”

3. Financial Aid Estimator 💰 (Future feature)

Uses income data and tuition models to suggest affordable schools.
