We chose the name PaideiaPilot to reflect the guiding philosophy behind our platform. "Paideia", rooted in Greek tradition, represents the classical ideal of educationâ€”an all-encompassing pursuit of intellectual and personal excellence. "Pilot" signifies navigation, direction, and mentorship, embodying how our system helps students chart their academic journey with data-driven insights. Together, PaideiaPilot captures our mission: to illuminate the path to college admissions success, offering students both wisdom and a strategic roadmap to achieve their highest potential. ðŸš€
